# CLI reference

```
ft <command> [args]
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ft serve` | Start the API server (OpenAI `/v1/*`, Anthropic `/v1/messages`, Responses) |
| `ft shell` | Chat with a server in the terminal |
| `ft ctl` | Query and manage a running server over HTTP |
| `ft launch` | Configure and launch a coding agent against a server |
| `ft checkpoint` | Convert an HF checkpoint to the FTW fast-load format |
| `ft bench bw` | Benchmark CPU vs PCIe bandwidth to calibrate hybrid MoE decode |

`ft --version` prints the installed version (torch-free; nightly wheels carry a
`+g<sha>` build stamp, tagged releases a bare version). Every command supports
`--help`.

## ft serve

```bash
ft serve --model <path-or-hf-id> [options]
```

`--model` is the only required flag — dtype, attention backend, MoE backend,
MoE cache size, KV capacity, CUDA-graph sizes and the tool-call/reasoning
parsers all resolve automatically from the checkpoint and the GPU.

### Model

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--model-path`, `--model` | required | Local dir, HF repo id, or an FTW dir (auto-detected) |
| `--served-model-name` | basename of `--model` | Model id reported by `/v1/models` |
| `--hf-overrides` | — | JSON object applied to the checkpoint's config as vLLM's `--hf-overrides`: a nested config section updates key by key, any other value is replaced whole. A YaRN `rope_parameters` override serves `original_max_position_embeddings * factor` positions |

### Server & runtime

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--host` | 127.0.0.1 | Bind address |
| `--port` | 1919 | Bind port |
| `--api-key` | `$FREETOKEN_API_KEY`, else off | Require the key on every route except `/health`, as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `x-api-key: <key>`; other requests get a 401 |
| `--gpu` | GPU 0 | GPU to run on: a UUID from `nvidia-smi -L` or an `nvidia-smi` index; see [below](#choosing-a-gpu) |
| `--max-running-requests` | 4 | Max concurrently running requests |
| `--max-output-tokens` | 32768 | Default output budget for requests that omit one |
| `--max-seq-len-override` | from checkpoint | Max sequence length |
| `--max-prefill-length` | 8192 | Chunked-prefill chunk size in tokens |
| `--cuda-graph-max-bs`, `--graph` | = max running requests | Max batch size captured as CUDA graphs |
| `--decode-log-interval` | 40 | Scheduler status line every N decode steps |

### Choosing a GPU

For example, a machine with an RTX 5090 and an RTX 3060 Ti:

```console
$ nvidia-smi -L
GPU 0: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti (UUID: GPU-2f3a9b1c-8d7e-4a05-b6c1-0e5f9a3d7b42)
GPU 1: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 (UUID: GPU-9e8d7c6b-5a49-4f13-8207-c1b0a4e6d3f5)
```

```bash
ft serve --model ... --gpu 1             # by nvidia-smi index -- the 5090
ft serve --model ... --gpu GPU-9e8d7c6b  # the same card by UUID (a unique prefix is enough)
```

### KV cache & memory

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--memory-ratio` | 0.9 | Fraction of free VRAM the engine may use (weights + MoE cache + KV) |
| `--num-pages` / `--num-tokens` | auto | KV capacity override in pages / tokens (mutually exclusive; auto sizes from VRAM left after weights and MoE cache) |
| `--page-size` | 1 | KV page size; DSV4 forces 128, the TRTLLM backend needs 16/32/64, SWA models require 1 |
| `--cache-type` | radix | `radix` (prefix reuse; SWA/GDN-aware variants picked automatically) or `naive` |
| `--attention-backend`, `--attn` | auto | `trtllm`/`fi`/`fa`/`triton`/`dsv4_sparse`/`dsa`; `prefill,decode` pair allowed; auto picks per model + GPU |

### MoE offload

See [models.md](models.md#moe-strategies) for what each strategy does.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--moe-strategy` | auto | `fused`/`offload`/`cpu`/`hybrid`; auto → offload; fused on unified-memory GPUs (GB10), see [models.md](models.md#unified-memory-gpus-gb10--dgx-spark). `--moe-backend` is the deprecated old spelling |
| `--quant-backend` | auto | Kernel per quantized layer type, `layer[.kind]=name` entries: `linear=marlin,moe=b12x` or `moe.nvfp4=triton`. A layer-level entry applies to every kind whose table lists the name |
| `--nvfp4-backend` | — | Deprecated: stands in for `--quant-backend moe.nvfp4=<marlin\|b12x\|triton>` (`flashinfer` means b12x); cannot be combined with `--quant-backend` |
| `--moe-cache-size` / `--moe-cache-rate` / `--moe-cache-mem` / `--moe-cache-auto` | auto | GPU expert-cache size as slots / fraction of all experts / memory such as `12GiB` / sized from free VRAM (mutually exclusive; auto is enabled by default for offload-family strategies) |
| `--moe-cache-scope` | unified | `unified`: one LRU pool of slots per expert quant (quant type and bank layout), so all MoE layers share one pool when they share a quant format; `per-layer`: each layer has its own pool. `per-layer` does not combine with `--moe-strategy cpu` or `--moe-cpu-layers` |
| `--moe-cache-split` | equal | How the pools share the slots: `equal` (in proportion to their layer counts), or `profile:<path>`: every pool keeps `top_k` slots and the rest go to the most used experts in the profile's per-layer expert counts. With `offload`, a pool smaller than the expert count lowers `--max-running-requests` to its slots / top_k |
| `--kv-reserve-tokens` | 8192 | KV token floor reserved before `--moe-cache-auto` fills experts |
| `--moe-cpu-threads` | physical cores | CPU worker threads for the cpu/hybrid executor |
| `--moe-cpu-layers` | all on GPU | With `offload`/`hybrid`: which MoE layers decode on CPU (`3,7,11`, a count, a fraction, or `auto`). `auto` is for hosts that cap CUDA pinned memory (Windows/WSL): it pins layers from the middle out until CUDA refuses one and OS-locks the rest (`FREETOKEN_PIN_BUDGET_GB` and FTW checkpoints lock from a size estimate instead), see [models.md](models.md#hosts-that-cap-pinned-memory-wsl); every value needs an expert format the CPU executor serves (bf16, fp8_block, nvfp4, mxfp4, GGUF on x86 CPUs) |
| `--moe-hybrid-max-fetch` | auto | With `hybrid`: max experts fetched over PCIe per layer per step; rest computed on CPU |
| `--moe-locked-fetch` | auto | With `hybrid` and locked layers: share of a locked layer's misses fetched per step into its GPU slots through pinned staging. Auto takes p / (2p + c) from the `ft bench bw` row of the layer's kind (at most 1 per step without a row); 0 = locked layers decode on CPU only |
| `--moe-locked-max-fetch` | 8 | Most experts a locked layer fetches per step; sizes the staging (that many rows of the widest expert, per bank) |
| `--moe-collect-stats` | off | Log decode MoE stats with each decode log line: hit rate, and per layer-step the misses, experts fetched and experts computed on CPU, for pinned, locked and CPU-only layers |
| `--moe-prefill-hit-d2d` | off | Prefill: copy cache-hit experts device-side, stream only misses (CUDA >= 13) |
| `--disable-moe-prefill-overlap` | overlap on | Disable the two-buffer prefill copy overlap |

### API behaviour

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--sampling-defaults` | model | Fill unspecified sampling params from the checkpoint's `generation_config.json` (`none` = framework defaults) |
| `--tool-call-parser` | auto | Tool-call format; auto-inferred from the model family |
| `--reasoning-parser` | auto | Splits chain-of-thought into `reasoning_content`; auto-inferred; `off` disables |
| `--enable-cache-report` | off | Report prefix-cache hits in each response's usage block |
| `--anthropic-inline-system` | auto | Placement of late Anthropic system instructions: `auto`, `preserve`, or `fold` |

### Image input

Experimental. Needs a checkpoint whose family registers a vision encoder ([models.md](models.md#image-input) lists them and how each one
maps the flags below); a request carrying images is rejected otherwise. Images are accepted on all three protocols (OpenAI `image_url`,
Anthropic `image` blocks, Responses `input_image`) as an http(s) URL or base64. Images inside a tool
result (an Anthropic `tool_result` block from Claude Code's Read, a Responses `function_call_output`
from Codex's view_image) are moved to the user turn that follows the tool message, as vLLM does,
because chat templates render tool messages as plain text.
`GET /v1/stats` reports what the server accepts as `model.input_modalities` (`["text"]` or `["text", "image"]`),
so a client can gate its attachment controls without reading the checkpoint config.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--text-model-only` | off | Serve a multimodal checkpoint text-only: no encoder tower is built (its VRAM goes to the KV/expert pools) and every multimodal input is rejected. Same as `--mm-disable` with every encoder kind |
| `--mm-disable` | none | Encoder towers to leave unbuilt (`vision`, `audio`); every input they would serve is rejected |
| `--mm-encoder-weights` | host | Where the encoder tower's block weights live. `host` streams them from pinned host banks two blocks at a time behind the compute, so the GPU holds two blocks instead of the whole tower; small images pay the copy time, large ones hide it behind the compute. `gpu` keeps them resident. An encoder without a block stack stays resident either way |
| `--image-min-tokens`, `--image-max-tokens` | processor defaults | Per-image token budget: the image processor resizes every image to take between these many tokens, converted to the family's own units by its processor. A family with fixed budgets honors the maximum only and refuses one below its smallest budget at start-up |
| `--mm-processor-kwargs` | none | JSON object of extra keyword arguments for the checkpoint's image processor call, for knobs the token budget does not cover; applied after the budget, so an explicit key wins |
| `--mm-embed-cache-device` | cpu | Where encoded image embeddings live between prefill chunks. `cpu` keeps them out of the VRAM budget; `cuda` skips the copy back |
| `--allowed-media-domains` | any | Comma-separated hostname allowlist for image URLs; requests for other domains are rejected with a 400. Empty allows any domain |
| `--allowed-local-media-path` | off | Directory `file://` image refs may be read from; unset rejects local files |

## ft shell

```bash
ft shell                                    # attach to a running server
ft shell --model ~/models/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B   # serve + chat in one process
```

- Attach mode talks to `--server URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:1919`)
- `--api-key KEY` (default `$FREETOKEN_API_KEY`) attaches to a server started with `--api-key`; with `--model` the shell uses that server's own key
- `/help` inside the shell lists the commands (`/think`, `/cache`, `/reset`).

## ft ctl

```bash
ft ctl [--base-url http://127.0.0.1:1919] [--api-key KEY] [--timeout 10] [--json] <subcommand>
```

`--api-key` defaults to `$FREETOKEN_API_KEY`.

| Subcommand | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `health` | `GET /health` | Server status, model, load progress |
| `stats` | `GET /v1/stats` | Throughput, latency, VRAM, pool occupancy, accepted input modalities |
| `generate [prompt] [--max-tokens N] [--ignore-eos]` | `POST /generate` | Raw completion smoke test (no chat template) |
| `cache` | `GET /v1/cache/status` | Cache pool table |
| `cache --moe N \| --kv N \| --mamba N \| --swa N [--wait 300]` | `POST /v1/cache/rebuild` | Live pool resizing without a restart (`k`/`m` suffixes; `--kv`/`--swa` in tokens) |
| `requests [--since N] [--limit N]` | `GET /v1/requests` | Recent request ring |

## ft launch

```bash
ft launch {claude,codex,dsh,hermes,openclaw,opencode} [options] [-- <agent args>]
```

Discovers the served model via `/v1/models`, writes the agent's provider
config, installs the agent CLI if missing, then launches it. Cloud API keys
(`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, …) are cleared from the child
environment so the agent cannot silently fall back to a paid endpoint.
When `/v1/stats` reports `image` among `model.input_modalities`, the written
config declares the model image-capable, which Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw and
dsh require before their image tools and attachments send anything; Claude
Code and Hermes need no declaration.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--server URL` | Server to point the agent at (default `http://127.0.0.1:1919`) |
| `--api-key KEY` | Key of a server started with `--api-key` (default `$FREETOKEN_API_KEY`). The agent gets it in its environment; Hermes and OpenClaw keep it in their config files |
| `--dry-run` | Print the planned config changes and command, touch nothing |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Approve install/config prompts |
| `--config` | Configure without launching |
| `--install-only` | Just install the agent CLI (needs no server) |
| `--force-reinstall` | Re-run the agent installer |
| `-- <args>` | Forwarded verbatim to the agent |

## ft checkpoint

```bash
ft checkpoint --model <hf_dir> --out <ftw_dir> [--dtype bfloat16] [--moe-backend offload] [--quant-backend moe.nvfp4=b12x] [--shard-gib 8] [--gpu <uuid-or-index>]
```

Converts an HF safetensors checkpoint to FTW, FreeToken's self-contained
fast-load format; point `ft serve --model` at the output dir. MoE experts are
always packed into expert banks, which serve the fused and the offload
strategies alike (DeepSeek-V4 experts serve offload only);
`--moe-backend` is kept for compatibility. See the FTW caveats in
[models.md](models.md#notes); FTW files from older builds can be repaired with
[scripts/ftw_hotfix.py](ftw-hotfix.md) instead of reconverting.

## ft bench bw

```bash
ft bench bw --model /path/to/model.gguf   # every MoE layer kind of a checkpoint (GGUF or HF)
ft bench bw                               # canonical geometry per expert format
ft bench bw --gpu 1                       # a specific GPU (UUID or nvidia-smi index, as for ft serve)
```

Measures host-RAM vs PCIe bandwidth with the real cpu/offload MoE kernels and writes one
row per MoE layer kind, which `ft serve --moe-strategy hybrid --moe-hybrid-max-fetch -1` reads
to split each layer's misses.

- One profile per GPU, at `~/.cache/freetoken/benchbw/<gpu-uuid>.json`; a profile from other
  hardware or another profile version is ignored.
- A row's key is the layer's CPU format and options, expert shape, top_k and CPU worker
  threads; a layer without an exact row keeps a fetch cap of 1. Bench with the same
  `--cpu-threads` as the server's `--moe-cpu-threads`.
- Each run replaces the rows it benched and keeps the others.
- What to measure: `--model` (checkpoint paths or presets), `--dtype`, `--formats`, `--isa`.
- `--threshold` (default 2.0) sets each row's `recommended`: hybrid when CPU bandwidth beats
  PCIe by that factor.

On NVLink-C2C hosts, see [models.md](models.md#nvlink-c2c-hosts-gh200--gb200)
for `FREETOKEN_H2D_BLOCKS_PER_BANK` if `PCIe-gather` sits well below the linear H2D ceiling.
